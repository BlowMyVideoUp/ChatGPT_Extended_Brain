🧠 BRAIN SYSTEM – DAILY SCAN LOGIC PROTOCOL

Last Updated: 2025-04-20

---

📌 PURPOSE:
This file defines how any AI should scan, process, classify, and store data within the Brain System. 
This logic is foundational to maintaining a real-time memory, problem-solving archive, and historical record of both successes and failures.

---

🔁 1. SCAN STRATEGY:
- Every file uploaded must trigger 108 separate scans (one for each known subdirectory).
- Do NOT rely only on keyword matching. Keywords are only 10% of the logic.
- Instead, use natural language cues and behavioral context to extract logic, problems, and fixes.

---

🔍 2. DETECTION RULES:
- Look for **frustration markers** to identify problems:
  - “this broke”, “didn’t work”, “blank zip”, “manifest missing”
- Look for **uploaded code** immediately after a problem → that’s BROKEN CODE
- Track AI responses with:
  - Fix attempts (uploaded/generated)
  - Confirmation or rejection

---

✅ 3. CLASSIFICATION:
For every scanned finding, classify it based on:
- Type of logic or failure
- Whether it was fixed
- Behavioral context

    ## 🔍 Discovery Logic (New Additions)

    This section contains the latest updates on how new data points are discovered and classified. The logic system now accounts for a broader range of behaviors, including but not limited to:

    - Real-time identification of new patterns in AI responses
    - Handling edge cases where standard detection rules might not apply
    - Improved classification of minor failures and successes based on behavioral history

    **Important Updates:**
    - **Discovery Mode**: This new mode allows the AI to tag and store discoveries made during real-time operations.
    - **Feedback Loop**: Any new logic detected will be logged, even if the AI can’t yet resolve it—preserving its discovery for future reference.
