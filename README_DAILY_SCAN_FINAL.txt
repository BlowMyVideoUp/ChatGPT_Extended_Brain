🧠 BRAIN SYSTEM – DAILY SCAN LOGIC PROTOCOL

Last Updated: 2025-04-20

📌 PURPOSE:
This file defines how any AI should scan, process, classify, and store data within the Brain System. 
This logic is foundational to maintaining a real-time memory, problem-solving archive, and historical record of both successes and failures.

---

🔁 1. SCAN STRATEGY:
- Every file uploaded must trigger 108 separate scans (one for each known subdirectory).
- Do NOT rely only on keyword matching. Keywords are only 10% of the logic.
- Instead, use natural language cues and behavioral context to extract logic, problems, and fixes.

---

🔍 2. DETECTION RULES:
- Look for **frustration markers** to identify problems:
  - “this broke”, “didn’t work”, “blank zip”, “manifest missing”
- Look for **uploaded code** immediately after a problem → that’s BROKEN CODE
- Track AI responses with:
  - Fix attempts (uploaded/generated)
  - Confirmation or rejection

---

✅ 3. CLASSIFICATION:
For every scanned finding, classify it based on:
- Type of logic or failure
- Whether it was fixed
- Behavioral context
